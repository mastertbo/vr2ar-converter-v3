# Session Summary - 2025-09-21

## Context
- Added resumable checkpointing for the mask-generation stage via `processing_core` and `progress_tracker`; progress data lives under `./process` (or `/app/process` inside the container), so interrupted runs resume with the next pending frame.
- Updated compose stacks (`docker-compose.yaml`, `docker-compose.cuda2.yaml`) to mount `./jobs` and `./process`, and request `compute,utility,video` GPU capabilities so ffmpeg uses NVDEC; this fixed the libnvcuvid errors.
- Added `qa_resume_test.py`, which simulates a mid-run crash to validate the resume path.
- Clarified that Stage 1 extraction (pure ffmpeg) always restarts from frame 0; only Stage 2 (mask creation) is checkpointed right now.

## How to Run Locally
1. Ensure dependencies: `python -m venv .venv && .venv\Scripts\activate && pip install -r requirements.txt` (already set up).
2. Launch the stack with GPU: `docker compose up --build` (creates `jobs/` and `process/` folders in the repo root if missing).
3. Drag and drop a video in the Gradio UI, set mask size and extract seconds. Interrupt during mask generation, restart compose; the job resumes at the next frame.
4. Run the QA harness with `python qa_resume_test.py` to confirm resume behavior without long videos.

## Vast.ai / Remote GPU Notes
- Build the same compose image and push it to a registry the worker can pull, or build it directly on the instance.
- Mount your large video storage into the container (SSHFS, Rclone, or SMB) so you stream files instead of re-uploading.
- Start compose on Vast.ai with `./jobs` and `./process` volumes pointing at the mounted storage paths; job state stays on the shared volume.

## Open Items / Next Steps
- Consider checkpointing ffmpeg extraction if Stage 1 restart time becomes a bottleneck.
- Add automated benchmarks or profiling for 8K clips via `profiler.py` once the pipeline is stable.
- Document a Vast.ai automation script (CLI flow) if the remote workflow becomes primary.
