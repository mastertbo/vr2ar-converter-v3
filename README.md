# VR2AR Converter 3

Convert your adult VR Videos into Passthrough AR Videos.

- Difference to https://github.com/michael-mueller-git/vr2ar-converter is other platform (docker) and used method. v1 and v2 have some mask merge jitter problems which i solved in v3 by using a custom  ArVideoWriter. Due to the diffrent programming languages in v1 vs v3 i can not backport this fix to v1. Therefore i recommend to use v3.
- Difference to https://github.com/michael-mueller-git/vr2ar-converter-v2 is this container uses more modern models for background removal ([MatAnyone](https://github.com/pq-yang/MatAnyone)). This repo therefore replaces v2.

Use the provided container and deploy on device with nvida gpu. Then use the buildin `grad.io` webui to convert your videos.

## Highlevel Usage

1. Create smal video chunks you want to convert to passthrough with no scene changes (i recommend chunks with length smaler than 3 minutes)
2. Process these chunks via the provided gradio webui
3. Wait for complete of process.
4. Download the result
5. Combine your chunks back into on video
